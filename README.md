************ SU-27SK aircraft package  for flightgear ******************
************************************************************************

	This is an implentation for the SUKHOI's  SU-27 4th generation fighter 
    aircraft , made under linux and FGFS 3.4 , but it should support v3.2 
    and may be some older versions .


 This work uses a lot of models and scripts  and other works made by 
 * the FGUK-team for their SU-27 prototype ,
 * MIG-29 developers, 
 * The F-15 developers,(their svg hud was a huge help ),
 * The F-16 developers,
 * The Mirage2000-5 developper ,
 * A lot of fg-Aircrafts developpers ,
 So Greetings and THANKS to all of them .
 
	The current aircraft package is at version 0.4 , so this is an "EARLY DEVELOPPEMENT" version , 
    just published for Fun, Tests, and may be some contributions .



FEATURES : 

*	A reasonnable (still under dev) JSBSim FDM .
* A well modeled airframe model (By FGUK-team, Fixed and updated by Me).
* A working cockpiot clickable Autopilot panel , kept compatibility 
		with the well known default FG's autopilot dialog, and some other
		fuctions(ILS landing , Alt hold , Nav and route follow , Heading hold
		and a lot of other fuctions.
* An canvas SVG hud (still in developpement ) that support navigation route
		marker and Radar targets markers .
* A working Radar (Not an accurate prototype of the N-010 installed on 
		board of Su-27SK version of the fighter).
* Navigation Display , taking benefit from the ND Framwork , but still 
		not similar to the Su-27 one (I think it's just a matter of styling).
* A radar screen display can be switched between ND and tactical mode as 
		in a real aircraft .
* A large range of sounds for various simulation and avionics effects, 
		including a russian voice for cockpit warning .
* Weapon Systems(GSh-30 gun and missiles including 4 types of R-27 variants and R-73) and Emesary damage system .
* A J-11A variant with Chinese labled cockpit by FGPRC team  .
* Lot of other effects and avionics that I hope you'll like :)  .

TODO : A lot , very lot of work , so please help .
